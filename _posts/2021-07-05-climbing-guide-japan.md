Finding information about climbing in Japan can be a daunting task. Where to go? How to find the guidebook? What about gear and anchors? How about local etiquette?

# Overview of climbing areas

I've always found it hard to get a good overview of what climbing Japan has to offer. If you ask about climbing in Japan, most people will happily point you in the direction of Ogawayama, which is undeniably one of the best sport climbing area in the country. But this can't be the only crag worth visiting now, can it? Of course not, but unfortunaltely discovering climbing areas relies mostly on the set of 4 guidebooks "フリークライミング 日本100岩場" (Free climbing japan, 100 rocks), that do nothing to inspire you to actually go climbing. These books, available in Japanese only, only contain vague descriptions of the climbing areas, and poorly drawn access maps and sketches of the main routes in each area. This information is often out-of-date, and missing a lot of recent developments. Still it remains the most comprehensive overview of most Japanese sport and trad climbing crags. This article compiles a list of some of the main climbing crags, along with pictures to hopefully inspire you to go and visit them!

## Guidebooks

Here is a list (non-comprehensive) of the main guidebooks. Most of them can be found at the [Calafate shop](https://www.calafate.jp/) near Ogawayama/Mizugaki. If you're in the area, I invite you to visit them as they are very knowledgeable and friendly towards foreigners.

## General guidelines

- Best season is typically spring and autumn. Summer is far too warm and humid (your best bet is Mizugaki/Ogawayama due to their high elevation), and in winter is usually too cold and snowy (ice climbing is great though).
- Toproping on fixed gear is usually not acceptable. Build your own anchor for toprope.
- Anchors are of various quality: from the omnipresent american death triangle on a bunch of slings from the last millenia to bomber chained anchors on glue-in bolts. In most areas there will be two carabiners that you can clip for lowering, but sometimes rings are used instead.
- Bolts vary in quality. You can find anything from old ringbolts, rusty 6mm bolts, to bomber 12mm expansion bolts or glue-ins. Sometimes all within the same area.
- Be respectful, leave no trace, replace fixed gear when damaged, respect the local rules (notably on parking)
- Bouldering: You can generally use other's crashpad if they're already placed on a boulder you want to climb (just ask). 

## Mizugaki (みずがき山)

Mizugaki is one of the largest climbing areas of Japan, with a rich climbing history. It has it all, bouldering, sport and trad, multipitch, and no matter how much you climb there you won't ever run out of things to climb. Mizugaki's multipich routes are a true heaven for granite and offwidth lovers!

- **Prefecture**: Yamanashi
- **Access**: [Mizugakiyamashizen Koen Camping Ground](https://goo.gl/maps/Szv7F76Uth9Fdhjj8)
- **Accomodation**: Campground or you can sleep in your car in the free parking lot in front
- **Access fee**: Free 
- **Style**: Trad multipich, sport multipitch, trad and sport single pitch, bouldering
- **Rock type**: Granite
- **Guidebook**: The Mizugaki guidebook is excellent, please refer to it for futher inspiration and all the information you will ever need for climbing in Mizugaki!
- **Best period**: Spring and Autumn. However due to its high elevation above 1600m, it is one of the best areas to survive climbing during the hot summer months. Winter is tricky, as temperatures are cold, and the access road to the main parking area is closed due to snow, which adds about a kilometer of walking.

## Ogawayama (小川山)

Ogawayama is a world-reknowned sport climbing and bouldering area, and is, along with its neighbour Mizugaki the biggest climbing area in Japan.

- **Prefecture**: Yamanashi/Nagano border
- **Access**: [Mawarimedaira Camping Ground](https://goo.gl/maps/hbQzR7BE35B4sYpr6)
- **Accomodation**: Campground ([website](http://w2.avis.ne.jp/~mawarime/)). No need for reservation there is more than enough space for everyone. You can arrive at anytime, simply take a ticket at the automated gate, set up your tent and go pay the next morning with your ticket. Be careful that if you wish to leave the campground and come back (for a supermarket run for instance), you'll need to get the staff at the hut to validate your ticket so that you can get out. If for some reason you need to leave during the night, be sure you've asked them beforehand or you'll be stuck inside!
- **Access fee**: 500yen/day/person to be paid at the Hut at the entrance (you can use the basic campground facilities such as water). 
- **Style**: Single-pitch sport and trad, multipitch, bouldering
- **Rock type**: Granite
- **Guidebook**: Unfortunately there is no dedicated guidebook to Ogawayama's sport climbing yet, although one is rumored to be under development. Refer to the "free climbing japan vol 2" or [ogawayama.online](https://ogawayama.online/). For bouldering: [Ogawayama Bouldering Area Guide](https://www.calafate.jp/esp/prdJA0214_OgawayamaBoulderingAreaGuide.html)
- **Best period**: Same as Mizugaki. In the winter the campground is closed and the road is proabably inaccessible (at least from the lower campground gate).

## Yamadera

- **Prefecture**: Yamagata
- **Access**: Take the forest road on the left [here](https://goo.gl/maps/D9kRJh9zq6XGVryN7) and drive up the dirt road until you cross a small bridge and reach a large parking area ([about here](https://goo.gl/maps/ZaozFfF3MpQak3AE9)).

Follow the trail up to it.
- **Accomodation**:
  - Yamadera parking lot (remote, no internet, no facilities, river water not recommended for drinking)

## Misaki (三崎公)

- **Prefecture**: Akita/Yamagata border
- **Access**: [Parking](https://goo.gl/maps/4F9aC8jU8HnhEt5c7). Walk along the coast path until you reach the small lighthouse. A few meters further down, there is a small climbers path leading down to the right towards the cliff edge through the vegetation (pay attention, it's barely noticeable). About a dozen meter down the path you'll find fixed ropes that will lead you all the way to the bottom of the cliffs.
- **Accomodation**: Campground or you can sleep in your car in the free parking lot in front
- **Access fee**: Free 
- **Style**: Seaside climbing with mostly sport single pitch, some trad.
- **Difficulty**: Mostly 5.11 and above. A few easier routes.

<Carousel name="misaki" />

## Samuraihama (侍浜)

- **Prefecture**: Iwate
- **Access**: There is no official parking lot, but you can park around [here](https://goo.gl/maps/D8ZvMB1kCeQLEXnn8) on the side of the road. Follow the path leading to the [Yokonuma Observatory](https://goo.gl/maps/5LfVgQmEgGCTwBkv5). There is a crag directly under the observatory. The other main area is about a hundred meters further to the left ([40°15'45.3"N 141°49'11.5"E](https://goo.gl/maps/UCiFTAhAbx8q3Kpd8)).

## Hyoutan Cave (ひょうたんケイブ)

- **Prefecture**: Iwate
- **Access**: Park [here](https://goo.gl/maps/D42EkgwU61owEmvD8). A dozen meter down the road, there is a faint trail on the left side, just after a road miror.

## Kuroiwa

- **Prefecture**: Gunma, close to Lake Haruna.
- **Access**: Park in the small parking lot next to a big hairpin curve of the road ([here](https://goo.gl/maps/YifpKXhBesiXS89t6)). Walk up the slope at the apex of the hairpin towards the visible cliff.
- **Accomodation**: I highly recommend the nearby ["Climber's Chalet" of the Kokusai Climbing Club](http://japanclimbing.com) ([location](https://goo.gl/maps/n2amjpbgyoDQHtiN6)) managed by my good friend and rock climbing guide James Miller.
- **Best period**: Spring and Autumn. Accessible but cold in winter.
- **Style**: Mostly sport climbing, some trad, possibility of multipitch (although currently poorly developped).

## Suzuri-iwa

- **Prefecture**: Gunma, close to Lake Haruna and Kuroiwa crag.
- **Access**: Park at the [無料駐車場](https://goo.gl/maps/DNp7ymRwRbLP8sjQ8) parking lot. The trailhead is about 50m further up the road on the left. Follow the path for about 200-300m to reach the top of the cliff. If you cut accross the slope to the right just before the wooden steps of the final climb, you'll reach the bottom of the cliff instead.
- **Accomodation**: Same as for Kuroiwa 
- **Best period**: Spring and Autumn. Accessible but cold in winter.
- **Style**: This crag hasn't seen much activity for quite a long while, and being in the woods, it is generally quite mossy/dirty. Still there are some interesting lines to be done, in particular some enjoyable trad crack climbs, such as Close the Door (5.10b), see for yourself:

## Shimonita boulder

- **Prefecture**: Gunma
- **Access**: Park [here](https://goo.gl/maps/eZuX8YXz6KX8E9pdA). As there is limited amount of parking space, it is recommended to car-share. You can leave extra cars at the nearby [道の駅 しもにた](https://goo.gl/maps/rpmGKkQxEbvkxKEC9). Walk down to the river side.
- **Style**: Easy to hard limestone bouldering with good flat landing.
- **Guidebook**: "free climbing japan vol 2". You can find more information and an online topo [here](http://genbu2008.web.fc2.com/Free-climbing/110612/newpage8.html) (Japanese only)

## Maruyama (Toaru)

Maruyama is a climbing area near Mount Tsukuba, small but seeing active development. Information is hard to come by, most people (even Japanese) don't know of its existence. I'll do my best to write a separate detailed post about it as soon as possible.

- **Prefecture**: Ibaraki
- **Access**: The main crag is located here: [36°17'24.6"N 140°09'18.3"E](https://goo.gl/maps/Vk8nGy2MKPBnktRA7), just after wind turbines and a small shrine. There are boulders along the road leading up to it. If you go there on weekends it is likely that you'll find people there.
- **Guidebook**: None. There is a [private facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/453494212763649) that you can join to get information from the locals. If you're interested in climbing there contact me, and I'll introduce you (this was my local crag for over a year).
- **Style**: Short sport routes and bouldering
- **Rock type**: Granite
- **Best period**: Spring, Autumn, Winter. Too warm and humid in the summer, and mosquitoes are annoying.

## Kasama Boulder

- **Prefecture**: Ibaraki
- **Access**: Park at [千人溜駐車場](https://goo.gl/maps/9RAMLzo8hdJb6Vy68)
- **Guidebook**: There is a great [online guidebook](https://www.yumpu.com/nl/document/read/7686490/kasama). Alternatively you can try using "free climbing japan vol 2" (good luck).
- **Best period**: Spring, Autumn, Winter. Too warm and humid in the summer, and mosquitoes/spiders are annoying.
